# Tight integration of spatial and spectral features for BSS with Deep Clustering embeddings

This repository covers the EM algorithms proposed in the Interspeech paper "Tight integration of spatial and spectral features for BSS with Deep Clustering embeddings" presented at Interspeech 2017 in Stockholm.

Currently, the repository contains the EM algorithms presented in the paper and some alternative observation models.
